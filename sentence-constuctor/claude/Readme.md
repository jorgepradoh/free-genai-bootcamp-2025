## Claude Powered Assistant Guide

### Which Model
Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Q1 2025) 

I have the free version for Claude, the limit I have for prompting per day impacts the test capabilities.

AWS Bedrock version is Claude Sonnet 3.5 V2, could not get reference files to work with the chat playground only. It worked pretty well without the example files.

Claude prefers XML tags for its prompting structure.
